## Webpack boilerplate
This boilerplate was made to develop quickly new ideas.

It helps:
-   to transpile with Babel ES6 code
-   to bundle with Webpack JS files and hot reload client's code
- handle caching css/sass and js

**Install**
Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) first. After that:

    $ npm install

**Development mode**

    $ npm run dev
It launches a node.js server on `http://localhost:8080/`

**Production mode**

    $ npm start
